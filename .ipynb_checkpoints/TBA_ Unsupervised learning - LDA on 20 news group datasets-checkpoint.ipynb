It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/\\nearly 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,\\nthe front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is \\nall I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years\\nof production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you\\nhave on this funky looking car, please e-mail.\\n\\nThanks,\\n- IL\\n   ---- brought to you by your neighborhood Lerxst ----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]\n"
